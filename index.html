            <h2>A Message for You</h2>
            <p>Looking back on the last 10 years. It’s hard to put into words how much you mean to me. It’s incredible to think how we’ve been side by side since 8th grade, pushing through school, exams, late-night study sessions, and every challenge that came our way.
                
                From those early days in class to countless memories in college, you’ve been more than a friend—you’re truly my brother.Through thick and thin, you’ve been my rock—always pushing me to be better and never letting me give up. And  whenever the whole world was against me and i looked back I have always found you.

                I’m honestly so proud of you , even though it means you’ll be miles away. There’s no one I trust more than you, and I’m grateful for every single moment, laugh, and lesson we’ve shared. It’s been an amazing journey so far, and even if you’re in another city, nothing’s going to change that.
                
                Here’s to new adventures. Wherever life takes us, know that you’ve got a brother right here who’s always got your back. Stay amazing and Will miss your silly talks and obviously ek share km hoga 
            </p>
